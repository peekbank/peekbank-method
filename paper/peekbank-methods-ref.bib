Eye-tracking methodologies provide a means to measure infant visual perception with high temporal and spatial accuracy, and in increasingly naturalistic contexts with the innovation of head-mounted eye tracking. The current review provides a comparison between screen-based and head-mounted eye-tracking methods for use with infant populations, reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. This review also aims to summarize recommendations for best practices in infant eye tracking for both screen-based and head-mounted technology, including suggestions for designing experiments, calibration techniques, and analysis approaches. Moreover, we discuss the need for standardized procedures for experimental design and reporting data quality for investigations using eye tracking to examine infant development.},

After that, infants' comprehension vocabulary increases gradually in a linear way over 8--18 months, according to data from parental checklists. In contrast, infants' word comprehension improves robustly, qualitatively, and in a nonlinear way just after their first birthday, according to data from studies on spoken word comprehension. In this review, I integrate observational and experimental data to explain these divergent results. I argue that infants' comprehension boost is not well-explained by changes in their language input for common words, but rather by proposing that they learn to take better advantage of relatively stable input data. Next, I propose potentially complementary theoretical accounts of what makes older infants better learners. Finally, I suggest how the research community can expand our empirical base in this understudied area, and why doing so will inform our knowledge about child development.},

We examine the circumstances under which effects are strongest and measures are most reliable and use synthetic datasets to illustrate the relationship between effect size, measurement reliability, and statistical power. We then present six concrete solutions for more reliable infant research: (a) routinely estimating and reporting the effect size and measurement reliability of infant tasks, (b) selecting the best measurement tool, (c) developing better infant paradigms, (d) collecting more data points per infant, (e) excluding unreliable data from the analysis, and (f) conducting more sophisticated data analyses.

This paper analyzes 914 pointing, looking children (451 female, varied ethnicities, 2.5--6.5 years, dates: 2009--2019) in 36 word- or sound-learning experiments with two-alternative test trials. Looking proportions and pointing accuracy correlated strongly (r = .7). Counter to the ``looks first'' hypothesis, looks were not sensitive to incipient knowledge that pointing missed: when pointing is at chance, looking proportions are also. Results suggest one possible path forward for assessing continuous developmental change. Methodological best practices are discussed.},

We describe the scope of the problem and focus on how transparency is a part of the solution. A lack of measurement transparency makes it impossible to evaluate potential threats to internal, external, statistical-conclusion, and construct validity. We demonstrate that psychology is plagued by a measurement schmeasurement attitude: QMPs are common, hide a stunning source of researcher degrees of freedom, and pose a serious threat to cumulative psychological science, but are largely ignored. We address these challenges by providing a set of questions that researchers and consumers of scientific research can consider to identify and avoid QMPs. Transparent answers to these measurement questions promote rigorous research, allow for thorough evaluations of a study?s inferences, and are necessary for meaningful replication studies.},

However, the optimal method for assessing this ability in infancy remains unclear. To investigate this issue, we collected data from 70 participants (45.7\% female) at 10, 11.5, 18 and 24 months of age using two eye-tracking based tasks---the preferential looking- and mismatch paradigms---as well as parental reports on a short form of the Swedish Early Communicative Development Inventories (SE-CDI). Both eye-tracking-based paradigms correlated with concurrent and later vocabulary scores. However, while the preferential looking paradigm showed stability across time, the mismatch paradigm did not demonstrate longitudinal stability and its associations with vocabulary were sometimes in unexpected directions. These findings suggest that the mismatch paradigm may reflect shifting cognitive or attentional processes during development, highlighting the need for further investigation. In contrast, the eye-tracking based preferential looking paradigm, may offer an objective complement to parental reports for predicting subsequent vocabulary development in early childhood.},

  abstract = {Visual problems that occur early in life can have major impact on a child's development. Without verbal communication and only based on observational methods, it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of a child's visual problems. This limits accurate diagnostics in children under the age of 4 years and in children with intellectual disabilities. Here we describe a quantitative method that overcomes these problems. The method uses a remote eye tracker and a four choice preferential looking paradigm to measure eye movement responses to different visual stimuli. The child sits without head support in front of a monitor with integrated infrared cameras. In one of four monitor quadrants a visual stimulus is presented. Each stimulus has a specific visual modality with respect to the background, e.g., form, motion, contrast or color. From the reflexive eye movement responses to these specific visual modalities, output parameters such as reaction times, fixation accuracy and fixation duration are calculated to quantify a child's viewing behavior. With this approach, the quality of visual information processing can be assessed without the use of communication. By comparing results with reference values obtained in typically developing children from 0-12 years, the method provides a characterization of visual information processing in visually impaired children. The quantitative information provided by this method can be advantageous for the field of clinical visual assessment and rehabilitation in multiple ways. The parameter values provide a good basis to: (i) characterize early visual capacities and consequently to enable early interventions; (ii) compare risk groups and follow visual development over time; and (iii), construct an individual visual profile for each child.},

When data were averaged at the child level, performance on the looking-while-listening task correlated well with parent-reported word production of the same words, as expected. However, mixed-effects model comparisons suggested that at the word level, looking-while-listening performance was significantly predicted by age and total productive vocabulary, but not by parent-reported knowledge of a word once these factors were controlled for. These findings invite careful consideration regarding the adequacy of these two popular methods for capturing children's idiosyncratic knowledge of individual words.},

We here conducted a systematic review of the complete peer-reviewed English literature on automated eye tracking with children during their first two years of life (793 articles), and extracted dates of publication, author and population geographic affiliation, keywords and sample sizes. The results show that automated eye tracking in infant research is increasingly used, and is accompanied by larger sample sizes, which together suggests improved accessibility. There is a focus on WEIRD populations, and a few broad research topics (methods, language and attention) and specific topics (autism, faces) are dominating the field. The current focus leaves many areas of research understudied, yielding a large potential for more infant eye tracking in the future.},

  abstract = {Questions about early word knowledge pervade the literature on both typical and atypical language trajectories. To determine which words an infant knows, researchers have relied on two types of measures---caregiver-report and eye-gaze behavior. When these measures are compared, however, their results frequently fail to converge, making it difficult to ascertain whether a given infant knows a given set of words. What are the reasons for these misalignments in gold-standard tasks that are designed to investigate the same underlying construct, and can convergent validity be improved? The current study was designed to investigate multiple methodological features of caregiver-report and looking-while-listening (LWL) tasks hypothesized to contribute to their alignment. American English-learning infants (18--20 months; N = 52) completed an LWL task assessing their understanding of eight early-acquired words. Caregivers reported their child's knowledge of the same eight words, as well as their confidence in their responses and the amount of time they spend with their child. Overall, caregivers' reports of word knowledge did not predict infants' eye-gaze behavior. However, the measures were more likely to be aligned when caregivers reported higher confidence in their responses. Caregivers' reports about both the target and the distractor word on each trial were related to infants' eye-gaze behavior, suggesting that LWL tasks capture knowledge about the labels of both objects tested, not just the label of the target object. The results suggest several critical methodological modifications that could be implemented to improve the measurement validity of both caregiver-report and eye-gaze measures of word comprehension. Summary This study provides novel insights to improve the validity of infant vocabulary measurement by highlighting factors that explain differences between caregivers' reports and eye-gaze behavior. Caregivers' reports of individual word knowledge failed to converge with infants' eye-gaze behavior during a looking-while-listening (LWL) task. Caregivers' reports of individual word knowledge aligned more strongly with their infant's eye-gaze behavior when caregivers reported more confidence in their responses. Caregivers' reports of both the target and the distractor words predicted infants' eye gaze behavior.},
